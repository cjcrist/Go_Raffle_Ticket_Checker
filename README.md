## Raffle Ticket Checker

This project is a simple raffle ticket checker written in Go and using HTTP requests API.
The project checks the numbers of the Michigan Lotto Daily 3 evening drawing, scrapes the dates for the Saturday night drawing, and compares them against user input raffle numbers. This is a refresh to the python Raffle Ticket Checker as I wanted to speed up the execution time using web requests, while writing it in Go.
