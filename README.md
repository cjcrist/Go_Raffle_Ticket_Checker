## Raffle Ticket Checker

This project is a simple raffle ticket checker written in Go and using HTTP requests api.
The project checks the numbers of the Michigan Lotto Daily 3 evening drawing, and scrapes the dates for the Saturday night drawing. This is a refresh to the python Raffle Ticket Checker as I wanted to I wanted to speed up the execution time with web requests, while writing it in another language.
